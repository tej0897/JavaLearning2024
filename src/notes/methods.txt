About Methods:

Methods are a block of code that are written to do something with the parameters and return the result.
Example, if the return type is int and the parameters are two numbers, and the ask is to add them and send it, the code will look like the following:

public int addNumbers(int a, int b){
    return a+b;
}

A method can be called whenever we need them.
*** If we want to access a method FROM a static method, the called method should also be static
i.e. static method can call static methods, a static method cannot call a non-static method

Work around for static vs non-static method is to create an Object of the class and call it via dot operator.

                ******************

Abstract methods are the ones that are declared, but not defined.
Let's say we have created a method, but we want to define it later, we can use abstract modifier and leave it for the moment. Whoever extends this class will define. (provide the body)

If we have at least one abstract method in our class, then the class must be made abstract.
(creating objects for an abstract class is different)

Example: abstract void sayHello(String name);


                ******************

synchronized:
    If a method is marked synchronized, then only one thread can access this method at a time in multi-threading environment.
