Classes And Objects

Class:

A model / blueprint to create an Object.
Example: PersonPackage Class

PersonPackage Class will have different attributes like weight, height, gender AND few methods like walk(), sleep(), dance()

Using this template, we can create an Object "Alex" by setting the values to attributes and methods.

______________________________________________________

Rules for Class:

1. If we have Public Class in our file, then the public class name should be same as Filename.
2. Public class of the file should have main method.
3. There can be only one Public Class per source code file.
4. Package name should be the first line of source file.
5. Import statement should be after package statement and before class declaration.

Life of Objects

When we create a new Object, a heap of memory will be created and the objectName will refer that heap.
Example: PersonPackage a = new PersonPackage();

If we are referencing an object by assigning value, then it will just point to the referred object. New Object will be created only when we create an object using new keyword.

Example: PersonPackage b = new PersonPackage();

PersonPackage c = b;   -> in this case, person c will point towards b, will not create new object.

b = a;  -> person b, from pointing to b, will point to a now. only c is pointing towards b object now.

c = a;  -> now all 3 objects are pointing towards AObject, nothing is pointing towards B, JVM will automatically remove this heap from memory and put it in garbage collector since it is not being used.

Access Modifiers :  can be given to Class, Variable, Method, Interface, Constructor

1. public       : Can be accessed from anywhere.
2. protected    : Code in same package and subclasses from other package can access.
3. default      : Code in same package can be accessed.
4. private      : Code within the same class can access.
